# Liante's Cogs
This repository will contain cogs made by @Liante#0216 for [Red-DiscordBot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/master)

## Cogs
Right now the only one working is levels. I'm looking forward to expanding this list, but the process can be somewhat slow since I don't have a lot of time at the moment.

#### Levels
**Stage: alpha**

This is a simple leveling system inspired by the Leveler for V2 Cog by [AznStevy](https://github.com/AznStevy/Maybe-Useful-Cogs).
It's highly configurable and has a few tweaks that make it different from most level systems I've seen so far for Discord.

## Suggestions? Contributions?
I'm only getting started with Python and development for discord.
