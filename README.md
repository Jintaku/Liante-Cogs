# Liante's Cogs
This repository will contain cogs made by @Liante#0216 for [Red-DiscordBot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/master)

## Cogs
Right now the only one working is levels. I'm looking forward to expanding this list, but the process can be somewhat slow since I don't have a lot of time at the moment.

#### Levels
**Stage: beta**

This is a simple leveling system inspired by the Leveler for V2 Cog by [AznStevy](https://github.com/AznStevy/Maybe-Useful-Cogs).
It's highly configurable and has a few tweaks that make it different from most level systems I've seen so far for Discord.

#### Serverstats
**Stage: alpha**

This should help track the server activity. It doesn't log message content, only how many messages were sent in certain period of time.
As the stage suggests, don't expect any functionality or documentation at the moment. Use at your own risk.

#### ImageCooldown
**Stage: pre-alpha**

A cog to set limits to attachments. Helps prevent spam. This is in development, incomplete, and untested.

## Suggestions? Contributions?
I'm only getting started with Python and development for discord.
